We can concatenate these features with the sentence embeddings of the titles and descriptions before computing the cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Use clustering algorithms**: Instead of grouping products based on a fixed similarity threshold, we can use clustering algorithms such as K-Means or DBSCAN to group similar products together. These algorithms can automatically determine the optimal number of groups and assign products to groups based on their similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use image processing**: If our products have images, we can use image processing techniques to extract visual features from the images and use them to measure the similarity between products. We can use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract these features and concatenate them with the sentence embeddings before computing the cosine similarity.\n",

        "By incorporating these techniques, we can improve the accuracy of our model in grouping similar products together."
